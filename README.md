# Branch-Prediction-Simulator
Simulated Bimodal, Gshare and Hybrid branch predictors which predicts a branch as taken/not taken based on indexing.
The number of mispredictions and thereby the misprediction rate for each case is found.
Also, the values are analyzed and the most optimum design is reported.
